We'll never get free
Lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water
The price of your greed
Is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water

Look me in my eyes
Tell me everything's not fine
Or the people ain't happy
And the river has run dry
You thought you could go free
But the system is done for
